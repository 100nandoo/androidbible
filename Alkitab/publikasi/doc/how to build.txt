[Requirements]

- Eclipse (at least the Java development version)
- ADT (Android Development Tools) plugin for eclipse, at least version 14
- Android SDKs. The easiest is, just install all versions available that are not manufacturer-branded and not deprecated.
- Git

[Getting the sources]

1. Clone the Bible for Android git repository to <your directory of choice>/alkitab-android/

    git clone git@git.assembla.com:alkitab-android.git
    
   You need to use public/private key pairs to easily authenticate yourself. Go figure.

2. Clone the yuku-android-util project from Google Code to <your directory of choice>/yuku-android-util/

    git clone https://yukuku@code.google.com/p/yuku-android-util/
    
   See the full instructions here: http://code.google.com/p/yuku-android-util/source/checkout

[Setting up]

1. Open Eclipse and handle the mess by yourself.

2. Install ADT to Eclipse, handle the problems by yourself.

3. Restart Eclipse as necessary

4. (Optional) Go to Eclipse Preferences -> Android -> Build
   use the debug.keystore on the alkitab-android repository as the "Custom debug keystore". 

5. Import the following projects into Eclipse:
   - from alkitab-android
     - Alkitab
     - AlkitabConverter
     - AlkitabYes
     - BiblePlus
   - from yuku-android-util
     - AmbilWarna
     - KirimFidbek
     - BintexReader
     - FileChooser
     - AndroidCrypto
     - FlowLayout
     - SdkSearchBar
     - SimpleTrove
   ... and you know that this document may be outdated, so you need to add necessary projects by yourself.
     
[Building and running]
