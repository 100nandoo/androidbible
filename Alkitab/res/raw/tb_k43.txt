The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.
When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;
And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.
Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?
@@Jesus answered, @6Thou couldest have no power @9at all@7 against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.@5
And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.
When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.
And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!
@@But they cried out, Away with @9him,@7 away with @9him,@7 crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.
@@Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led @9him@7 away.
@@And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called @9the place@7 of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:
Where they crucified him, and two others with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.
@@And Pilate wrote a title, and put @9it@7 on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.
@@This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, @9and@7 Greek, @9and@7 Latin.
Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.
Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.
@@Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also @9his@7 coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.
@@Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the @9wife@7 of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

@@The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and @9that@7 they might be taken away.
Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.
But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:

@@And he that saw @9it@7 bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.

@@And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave @9him@7 leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.

Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.
Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.
@@There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation @9day;@7 for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.
@@The first @9day@7 of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.
Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.
Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.
So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.
@@And he stooping down, @9and looking in,@7 saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.
Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,
And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.
Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.
For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.
Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.
@@But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, @9and looked@7 into the sepulchre,

And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.
And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.
@@Jesus saith unto her, @6Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou?@5 She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.

But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.

And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:
But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.

Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.
