<p>When you run this application, you will immediately see the Bible text. Press the <strong>button</strong> below that is showing the verse address, like <kbd>Genesis 1</kbd>, to go to other parts of the Bible. Press the left and right button to move to the previous and next chapters.</p>
<p>Note: Some of the verses, especially in the book of Psalms, has numberings that differ between different translations and other translations (e.g. KJV). The chapter and verse numbers of the specific translation are written in parentheses.</p>

<h2><a name="berpindah"></a>Moving to Other Parts of the Bible</h2>
<p>To move to another part of the Bible, you can press the <strong>verse address button</strong>, like <kbd>Genesis 1</kbd> or press the MENU button to open the menu, then select <strong><a href="#tuju">Go to</a></strong> or <strong><a href="#loncat">Jump to</a></strong> (depending on the <a href="#pengaturanloncatdenganmudah">setting</a>). </p>
<p>If <a href="#pengaturantanpatombolnavigasi">No Navigation Buttons</a> setting is enabled, you can press the gray verse address bar above the text instead of the <strong>verse address button</strong>.</p>
<p>Hold (long-press) the <strong>verse address button</strong> to open the list of recent verses.</p>

<h3><a name="tuju"></a>Go to</h3>
<p>With the <strong>Go to</strong> menu, you can choose the book, chapter, and verse to open. To select a book, press the book name, then choose one from the list of books. The books are ordered according to the original ordering (Old Testament then New Testament then other books) or alphabetically, depending on the <a href="#pengaturankitabmenurutabjad">setting</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="loncat"></a>Jump to</h3>
<p>With the <strong>Jump to</strong> menu, you can directly type the <strong>verse address</strong>. How to write the <strong>verse address</strong> is: Write the first 3 or so characters of the book name, then the chapter number, then a space or a colon, then the verse number. For example <span class="kod">Luk 3:11</span> or <span class="kod">1Pe 2:5</span> (1 Peter 2:5).</p>
<p>However, <em>for your convenience</em>, you can also write it in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Type just the <strong>chapter number</strong> to go to the chapter on the same book. Example: <span class="kod">8</span></li>
	<li>Type the <strong>chapter number</strong> followed by the <strong>verse number</strong>. Example: <span class="kod">3 16</span>, <span class="kod">12:4</span></li>
	<li>Type the <strong>book name</strong> <em>just enough</em>. Example: <span class="kod">songs</span> (Song of Solomon), <span class="kod">1k</span> (1 Kings), <span class="kod">ps</span> (Psalms)</li>
	<li>Concatenate the <strong>book name</strong> and the <strong>chapter number</strong>: <span class="kod">Joh3</span>, <span class="kod">Gen48</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="pembatas"></a>Bookmarks</h2>
<p>Tap a verse and tap on the button that appears to open the a menu. On the menu there are options to <strong>Add bookmark</strong>. With bookmarks, you can mark verses that you think are important. You can also give a title and labels to each bookmark. Labels can be made by choosing <strong>Create label</strong>. Press MENU and select <strong>Bookmarks</strong> to see the list of bookmarks. Press one of the bookmarks to open it, or hold to change the title, labels, or to delete it. </p>
<p>By pressing MENU, you can also <strong>Export to SD Card</strong> or <strong>Import from SD Card</strong>. Use this to ensure that your bookmaks, notes, and highlights are stored properly in SD Card as a backup in case there is a problem with your phone.</p>

<h2><a name="cari"></a>Search</h2>
<p>You can find verses that contain certain words. Press the <strong>search button</strong> (with the magnifying glass symbol) on your mobile phone if available, or press MENU and select <strong>Search</strong>. </p>
<p>When the search screen opens, type the words that want to look for and click the button. The verses that contain <em>all</em> the words you entered will be displayed. For example, if you type <span class="kod">god son</span>, then even Genesis 4:25 would be displayed because it contains verses the word &quot;god&quot; and &quot;son&quot;, although not contiguous. If you type <span class="kod">just</span>, you will also find &quot;justice&quot;, &quot;justify&quot;, etc. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Use quotes to search for exact phrases. For example, <span class="kod">&quot;our father&quot;</span>.</li>
	<li>Use plus sign (+) exactly before a word to search a whole word. For example, <span class="kod">+eve</span> will find the exact word "eve" or "Eve" but not "eventually" or "evening".</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="renungan"></a>Devotion</h2>
<p><i>This feature is only available in the Indonesian version of Bible for Android (search for "Alkitab" in Android Market).</i></p>
<p>Press MENU and select <strong>Devotion</strong> to read some reflections which are provided every day. When you first open the devotion, you must be connected to Internet, because the devotion materials are available online. However, when you connect, the devotion from that day to 30 days later will be downloaded and stored so you do not need to be connected to the Internet to read the devotion of the following days. </p>
<p>Press the <kbd>Switch</kbd> button to read devotions from different sources. Press the left arrow or right arrow buttons to move between days. Open the menu to copy the contents of the devotion or to share them with others.</p>
<p>Some devotions contain verse addresses that you can press to jump directly to the verses.</p>

<h2><a name="versi"></a>Version</h2>
<p>You can read another version of the Bible (in different languages or different translations) by selecting the <strong>Version</strong> menu. At the beginning, there will be only one version available. Tap on <kbd>Other versions...</kbd> to add and manage Bible versions.</p>
<p>In the managing versions screen, there will be some pre-set versions that are ready to be downloaded. You will need to download the data file for that version beforehand. The data file will be stored in the SD Card. Each version occupies around 5 MB of space. After you download them once, you don't need to download them again.</p>
<p>If you have PDB files in PalmBible+ format, those files can be read by this application. This application does not directly read .pdb files, instead it will convert the .pdb files to its own format whose file name ends with .yes beforehand. This file is stored on the SD card/bible/yes folder with the file name generated depending on the PDB file opened. Long-press on one of the items on the version list, and select Details to check the location of the files and so on.</p>
