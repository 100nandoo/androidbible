Bible translations/versions
---------------------------

This app natively uses *.yes* files for the Bible text. You can create a *.yes* file easily by creating a plain text file
called a *.yet* file and converting it using the Yet2Yes utility. You will need just Java, you don't need Eclipse or Android SDK.

Building
--------

You'll need `http://code.google.com/p/yuku-android-util/` cloned to a directory in the same level
as this repo's cloned directory. So you will have `yuku-android-util` and `androidbible` side-by-side. 
The main project is `Alkitab` inside `androidbible`. BTW, Alkitab is Indonesian word for Bible.

This repository does not contain any Bible text.
