Bible translations/versions
---------------------------

This app natively uses *.yes* files for the Bible text. You can create a *.yes* file easily by preparing a plain text file. <a href="http://goo.gl/QEw0j">See instructions</a>.

You can also convert PalmBible+ PDB files using the built-in converter in the app or use the <a href="http://pdb2yes.alkitab-host.appspot.com/">pdb2yes online converter</a> 
that produces compressed YES files.

Integration with other apps
---------------------------

If you build an app that refers to the Bible, you can let the user read the Bible either in this app or in your app.
An Android library project `AlkitabIntegration` is available that you can include in your project. Your app can easily 
open this Bible app at a specified verse or get verses from this Bible app and display them in your app.

If you need help integrating it, please contact me.

Building
--------

You'll need `http://code.google.com/p/yuku-android-util/` cloned to a directory in the same level
as this repo's cloned directory. So you will have `yuku-android-util` and `androidbible` side-by-side.

The `v3` branch is the currently stable version, version 3.x.x. `develop` branch contains the latest updates.
Note: please use the `studio` branch for `yuku-android-util`.

By the way, Alkitab is the Indonesian word for Bible.
